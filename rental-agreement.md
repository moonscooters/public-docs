You acknowledge and agree that you and Moon are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.

You understand that those parties and entities include but are not limited to the claimant, respondent, witnesses, and Moon. The parties agree to split all FairClaims fees evenly. You agree that, in the event of confirmation and enforcement, the delinquent party to the arbitration will be responsible for any attorney, court or other fees associated with such action.  Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in this agreement, the parties agree and acknowledge that this arbitration clause evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.  (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and FairClaims Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.  If the FAA and FairClaims Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this arbitration clause or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of Utah.

### 31. Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

Moon will provide prior written notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective only after prior written notice and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the notice period.

In furtherance of this intention, the releases herein given shall be, and remain in effect as, full and complete releases notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different claim or fact.

Utah law and controlling U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable at law, such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed or reformed to the extent required to make it valid and enforceable, and this shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Agreement.
